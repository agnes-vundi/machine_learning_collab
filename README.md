### Machine Learning Algorithms- Supervised Learning: Regression
The project was done in a team of two. The goal of the project was find the best machine learning algorithm for regression.
The supervised learning algorithms implemented were:
   1. Linear Regression
   2. Decison Tree
   3. Random Forest
